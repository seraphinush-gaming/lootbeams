# Lootbeams
Erects a glistening shaft of light that penetrates the heavens over most items. Written at the request of a blind, slightly OCD friend.

### Commands
`!beams` toggles the module between enabled and disabled. Disabling will also clear any existing beams.

`!clearbeams` clears existing beams without toggling the module.

### Dependencies
Requires Pinkie Pie's [command](https://github.com/pinkipi/command) module.

### Default Settings
Ignores motes, strongboxes, and other items that already have a loot beam.
